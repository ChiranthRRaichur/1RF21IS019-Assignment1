# I successfully implemented a decision tree machine learning model to predict the quality of red wine. Leveraging features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and alcohol content, the model achieved notable accuracy in assessing wine quality. The project involved training the decision tree on a dataset, evaluating its performance using a confusion matrix, and ultimately providing insights into the factors influencing red wine quality. This predictive model contributes valuable tools for quality assurance and optimization in the red wine production process.
